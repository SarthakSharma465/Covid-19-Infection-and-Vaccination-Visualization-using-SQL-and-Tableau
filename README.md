# Technologies Used
-   Microsoft Excel
-   Structured Query Language(SQL)
-   Tableau Public


# Roadmap
- Firstly we downloaded the complete Covid-19 dataset from the following website https://ourworldindata.org/ which included all data regarding the number of deaths, vaccinations, dates, and different locations.
- Now comes the role of SQL, I first split my entire dataset into two parts: CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations.
- I queried my data on various parameters for example :
  1) Total cases versus Total deaths
  2) Total cases versus population in India
  3) Maximum infection rate in the world
  4) Rolling Sum of new vaccinations etc.
- I tried to query some of the dataset's many different and vital statistics.
- I selected 4 queries out of these queries and exported the data as Excel files.
- Now comes the role of Tableau, I inputted these query output tables into Tableau into different sheets and used them as data sources.
- I set up the parameters for different visualizations:
 -> Global Numbers
-> Total Deaths per Continent
-> Geographic Visualization
-> Location-Specific Time Series
-> Geographic Visualization of Fully Vaccinated Population
- Setting the various design aspects according to my choice was quite fun as we moved toward the completion of the project.
- Finally, I made a dashboard, imported all 4 sheets on the dashboard in an organized manner, and later uploaded all of my work on Tableau Public.
